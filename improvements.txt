EXTRA:
After working with the API and getting the data to show, come up with a list of ways that you could improve this API. What would make it more efficient for future calls? How could you structure the return better?

Q: What would make it more efficient for future calls? 
A: Implementing a way to catch errors

Q: How could you structure the return better?
A1: By improving the design of the UI in the following ways:
  - displaying the data on a card rather than on columns as it is now
  - giving the user the ability to expand & collapse the information when they 
    click to display the data
A2: Implementing a login system, adding validation & authentication so that not 
    just any random person has access to the information

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
I first used curl in the terminal to get the data from the api, 
then copied and pasted the code into the files labeled as such 
(tests.json and assoc_panel.json)
